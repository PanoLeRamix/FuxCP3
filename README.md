# Melodizer

This repository is home to three computer-aided composition projects in the form of Common Lisp libraries.

The first one, Melodizer, is an OpenMusic object allowing you to generate innovating melodic ideas from a sequence of chords that you give.

The second one, Melodizer2.0, is based on Melodizer but can generate polyphonic music. It has a specific data structure, called blocks, that can be combined both vertically and horizontally and constraints can be added on and between blocks.

The third one is still a work in progress. It is a formalization of counterpoint in the style of Johann Joseph Fux. Currently all five species of two-voice counterpoint are formalized and the library functions allow to generate counterpoint from user-specified cantus firmi. It does not currently have a user-friendly interface, but is already useable. Future improvements will be pushed regularly when available.

## How to use
All three libraries require GiL, a library linking Gecode to Lisp that can be found here[(https://github.com/sprockeelsd/GiL)]. All instructions on how to install it can be found on its github page.

Melodizer and Melodizer2.0 have pdf files explaining how they work and how to use them in their respective ***UserGuide*** folder. Since the Fux formalization is not finished yet, the instructions on how to use it are detailed below.

### Melodizer

#### Structure explanation
In Melodizer/sources, there are 4 files.

***melodizer-csp.lisp***
This file contains the Constraint Satisfaction Problem, including the creation of the variables, the search space, the posting of the constraints, the branching, and the search.

***melodizer-csts.lisp***
This file contains all the constraints available for the CSP.

***melodizer-utils.lisp***
This file contains all the auxiliary functions used in the project.

***melody-finder.lisp***
This file contains the code for the OM object.
