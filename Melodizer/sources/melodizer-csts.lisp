; ALL-DIFFERENT-NOTES constraint WORKS
; <sp> is the space
; <notes> is a list of IntVars
; ensures that all the notes are different in terms of strict value, not in terms of notes
; (e.g. 60 and 72 can be values taken by two variables simultaneously even though they both represent a C)
(defun all-different-notes (sp notes)
    (gil::g-distinct sp notes)
)

; DISSONNANCE RESOLUTION constraint TODO + develop comments
; Ensures that every sensitive note (4th or 7th) is eventually followed by the fundamental
; if it is a seventh note, it is followed by the fundamental that is above it (+1 if major, +2 if minor)
; if it is a fourth note, it is followed by either of the fundamentals around it (+7 or -5)

; INTERVAL-BETWEEN-ADJACENT-NOTES constraint WORKS
; <sp> is the space
; <notes> is a list of IntVars representing the pitch of the notes
; <intervals> is a list of IntVars representing the intervals between successive notes from the notes argument
; Ensures that the interval between two adjacent notes is valid
; The interval must be everything up to a minor sixth (it can be an octave) except for a tritone, a major seven or a minor seven

; IN TONALITY constraint WORKS
; <sp> is the space
