; MELODY-FINDER
; <input> is a list of lists with each list representing the midicent values of the chords on top of which the melody will be played
; <rhythm> the rhythm of the melody to be found in the form of a rhythmtree
; <key> is the key in which the melody is
; <mode> is the mode of the tonality (major, minor)
; This function creates the CSP by creating the space and the variables, posting the constraints and the branching, specifying
; the search options and creating the search engine.
