; MELODY-FINDER
; <input> is a voice object with the chords on top of which the melody will be played
; <rhythm> the rhythm of the melody to be found in the form of a voice object
; <optional-constraints> is a list of optional constraint names that have to be applied to the problem
; <global interval> is the global interval that the melody should cover if the mostly increasing/decreasing constraint is selected
; <key> is the key in which the melody is
; <mode> is the mode of the tonality (major, minor)
; This function creates the CSP by creating the space and the variables, posting the constraints and the branching, specifying
; the search options and creating the search engine.
