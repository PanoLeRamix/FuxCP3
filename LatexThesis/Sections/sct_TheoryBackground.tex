\chapter{Theoretical Background}
A complicated point with this kind of subject is the vast field of knowledge that composes it. Indeed, to be able to fully understand the rest of the thesis, it is necessary to have a good knowledge of musical theory rather than an in-depth knowledge of constraint programming. Music theory is very rich and applies differently from one culture to another, while CP is a younger field and easier to popularize broadly. For these reasons, it will be tempted to explain in more depth the sometimes ambiguous musical notions. 

The operation of Gecode and OpenMusic is not necessary for understanding the paper, so they do not have their own sections in this chapter. To learn more about these subjects, there is the documentation of Gecode\parencite{GecodeManual}, OpenMusic\parencite{OpenMusicDoc}, and \textcite{Melothesis}'s thesis which covers the essence of these two tools.

Before moving on to formalization, it is important to recall the fundamentals of music and its notation. The technical theory of constraint programming will be explained right after.
